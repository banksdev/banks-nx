✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

This is a proof-of-concept developed to showcase the improved quality-of-life in a monorepo setup when using `nx.dev`.
Furthermore, this PoC is used to improve my own knowledge and understanding on the tool as well as monorepos in general. 

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

Visit the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev) to learn more.

Run:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

To start the `backend` and `banks-app` applications. 
`backend` will spawn at `localhost:3333` while `banks-app` will spawn at `localhost:4200`.
